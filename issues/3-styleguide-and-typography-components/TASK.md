__Comment on web/src/components/typography/OL.tsx line 10__ 
`OL` needs a visual tweak. First lines and consecutive lines should have the same indentation / margin left. And an outset placement of numbers.

Same goes for `Ul` and bullet points..
__Comment on web/src/components/typography/H2.tsx line 10__ 
`H1` and `H2`: Provide balance for the top margin as well. Goal: always have more margin above than below. Also balance it out with the other elements who usually come with `mb-4`..


## CI Status
