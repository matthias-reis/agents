# CurrentTask: Work on Feedback for Implementation

- **ID**: `#11`
- **Title**: `Introduce MDX`
- **Workpackage Name**: `issues/11-introduce-mdx`

## Task Description

- A detailed plan has already been worked out and implemented, see `issues/11-introduce-mdx/PLAN.md` for more details. But there is feedback to address.
- Read the text below, especially the "Feedback Comments" and the "CI Status" section.
- Ensure that all relevant feedback is addressed in the codebase.
- Do **not** modify the plan.md as this has been previously approved.
- Append a line to `issues/11-introduce-mdx/cost.md` with:
  - timestamp (UTC), provider, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens, estUSD, headers snapshot (remaining/reset if available).
- create a local commit if possible. If not propose a commit statement including message.


## Feedback Comments

__Comment on web/src/routes/mdx.tsx line 8__ 
DANGER!

You completely failed the implementation goal. This is a transscriptiopn of the MDX file in HTML.

What is needed is code interpreting MDX and shipping it dynamically through MDX features..


## CI Status

__tests__: ❌
__build__: ✅
